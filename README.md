## `index.html` structure
### `<header>`:
Contains the main navigation to quickly refer to the different UI components.
### `<main>`:
Contains all the UI Components. Each UI component will be wrapped by an `<article>` tag. Each of these `<article>` elements 
has two children `<section>` elements: one for showcasing the UI component and one with a list of the different styling options for that component.
